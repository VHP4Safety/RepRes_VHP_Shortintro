Part of this workshop was reused from [FAIR in (biological) practice](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-bio-practice/05-intro-to-metadata/index.html#types-of-metadata).

We took [Exercise 1: Identifying metadata types](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-bio-practice/05-intro-to-metadata/index.html#exercise-1-identifying-metadata-types-4-min) out of context, but we actually would recommend looking at all their course material when you find the time, as they do some terrific work which we are very grateful for.
